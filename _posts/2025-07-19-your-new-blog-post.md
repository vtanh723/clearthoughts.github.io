## This is my first blog post, to test this blog (I have no idea what I'm doing)

Hopefully I can get this to work soon, ... so that I can post some useful stuffs for myself first

 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```

How about some Matlab code?

```matlab
t = -2*pi:1:2*pi;
x = sin(t);
y = diff(x);
plot(x);
hold on
plot(y);
```
